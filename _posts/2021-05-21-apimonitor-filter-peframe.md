title: Creating filter template for apimonitor
---

### Tools used
  
  API Monitor v2 (Alpha-r13) - x86 32-bit     [Download as per your OS](http://www.rohitab.com/downloads)
  peframe   [DOwnload and install from here](https://github.com/guelfoweb/peframe)
  
 
 ### Problem statement  
 During the Dynamic analysis of any file in window we often(we = me) use apimoitor from rohitab. It is a very handy tool, we can monitor the apicalls and argumets passed. 
 But problem I face is to quicly find out what apis to monitor how quckly we can check/select those apis.
 
 As I wrote this script specily for malware analysis, I used peframe by [@guelfoweb](https://twitter.com/guelfoweb)
